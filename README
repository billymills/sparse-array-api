c++ implementation of a two dimensional array in 3 ways:
actual two-dimensional array
vector of vectors
sparse array

Notes: 	
	run 'make' in root directory
	executable google test file 'sparse_test' will located in /test dir
	general implementation testing located in /build
	unresolved issue in sparse array remove method - problem at edges of array
